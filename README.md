### *The Image size can be easily kept as it was by using ```opencv``` python library.* 
> open notebook, before training the model resize you image as you want. Add a cell in notebook and resize image using following code: 
```python
import cv2
import os

height = None       #change as you need
width = None        #change as you need
url = ('style image url')

image = cv2.resize(url, height = height, width = width)

## Now use it..
```

### Environment 
Make sure you have all necessery python library installed. For this projects you need 
* Numpy
* TensorFlow
* Keras
  
if you don't have these libraries go to python or anaconda prompt and paste these:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
```
